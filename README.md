# Info

This repository contains the code for the [StreamLit app](https://sandra-jurela-airbnb-amsterdam-streamlit-app2-app-zi5wg6.streamlit.app/) I made for the **CoRise**'s [Python for Data Science](https://corise.com/course/python-for-data-science) course, which is a FREE 2-week cohort-based course on the fundamentals of scientific Python including using Python DS libraries (Pandas and Numpy) on real Airbnb data to create real-world projects.

Big thank you to [Luca Belli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbelli/) for setting up a great course, and to the entire CoRise team for supporting us through the journey.
